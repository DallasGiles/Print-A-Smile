      In 2022, the U.S. Census reported a child poverty rate of 16.3%, affecting millions of children and limiting their access to healthcare, education, and opportunities. For many, Christmas is a season of joy, but countless children miss out on the simple delight of receiving gifts due to financial hardships. At Print a Smile, we are committed to ensuring that every child experiences the magic of the holidays.

      By leveraging our existing printers and encouraging community members to share their own printing resources, we maintain a consistent supply of toys for donation. Whether these toys are distributed through partner organizations or gifted directly to families, our mission is clear: to print smiles on children's faces with each toy we create.
